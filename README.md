> **v1.7.0** — 550 tools across 26 services in 13 categories. Now with the **.0n Conversion Engine** (portable AI Brain bundles), **Vault** (machine-bound encrypted credential storage), **Application Engine** (build + distribute .0n apps), **Workflow Runtime** + **HTTP Server**, and a **CLI with named runs**. [See what's new](#-whats-new-in-v17).

---

## The Problem

You have **Stripe** for payments. **SendGrid** for email. **Slack** for messaging. **Airtable** for data. A **CRM** for contacts.

Today, to automate across them, you need:
- Zapier ($50+/month) — and build complex zaps
- n8n/Make — and learn their visual builders
- Custom code — and maintain API integrations forever

**What if you could just... talk to them?**

---

## The Solution

```
You: "Invoice john@acme.com for $500 and notify #sales on Slack when it's sent"
```

0nMCP **figures out the rest**:

```
Step 1: Found John Smith (john@acme.com) in Stripe
Step 2: Created invoice INV-0042 for $500.00
Step 3: Posted to #sales: "New invoice sent to John Smith for $500"

Done. 3 steps. 2 services. 1.2 seconds.
```

**No workflows. No mapping. No code. Just results.**

---

## Watch It Work

```bash
# In Claude Desktop after setup:

You: "Connect to Stripe with key sk_live_xxx"
AI:  Connected to Stripe (8 capabilities available)

You: "Connect to Slack with bot token xoxb-xxx"
AI:  Connected to Slack (4 capabilities available)

You: "Get my Stripe balance and post it to #finance"
AI:  Your Stripe balance is $12,450.00. Posted to #finance.
```

**That's it.** No configuration files. No workflow builders. No decisions about which API to use.

---

## Installation

### One Command

```bash
npx 0nmcp
```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g 0nmcp
```

### Configure Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Mac) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "0nmcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["0nmcp"],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-ant-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is **optional**. It enables AI-powered multi-step task planning. Without it, 0nMCP still works using keyword-based routing.

### Restart Claude Desktop. Start talking.

## Examples

### Simple Tasks

```
"Send an email to sarah@example.com: Meeting moved to 3pm"

"Create a Stripe customer for mike@startup.io"

"Post to #engineering on Slack: Deploy complete!"

"Send SMS to +1555123456: Your order shipped"

"What's my Stripe balance?"

"Search Notion for project roadmap"
```

### Multi-Step

```
"Create a Stripe invoice for $1000, then email the link via Gmail to john@client.com"

"Create a Jira issue for the login bug, then post it to #bugs on Slack"

"Look up sarah@example.com in my CRM and send her a follow-up email"
```

### Complex Orchestration

```
"Check if we have any overdue invoices in Stripe. If so, send a summary
 to #finance on Slack and email the finance team."
```

The AI:
1. Queries Stripe for overdue invoices
2. Formats a summary
3. Posts to Slack
4. Sends the email
5. Reports back

**You describe the outcome. AI figures out the path.**

### CRM Snapshots — Deploy Entire Configurations

```
"Deploy a full CRM snapshot with a 12-stage sales pipeline,
 all lead tags, custom values, and 18 workflow definitions"
```

One tool call. Everything deployed:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "name": "Sales Pipeline",
    "stages": ["001. New Lead", "002. Attempt to Contact", "003. Engaged",
               "004. Appointment Set", "005. Appointment Showed", "006. Proposal Sent"]

### With `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (AI Mode)

Claude analyzes your task, inspects connected services and their capabilities, creates a multi-step execution plan, runs every API call in order, passes data between steps, and summarizes the results.

### Without API Key (Keyword Mode)

The orchestrator uses keyword matching to route tasks to the right service. Less intelligent but still functional for straightforward single-service requests.

## Why Not Just Use...

| | **0nMCP** | Zapier | Custom Code |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Setup time** | 2 minutes | 30+ min per zap | Hours/days |
| **Learning curve** | None (natural language) | Medium (visual builder) | High (APIs, auth) |
| **Multi-step tasks** | Just describe it | Build complex zaps | Write orchestration logic |
| **Cost** | Free + your API keys | $20-$100+/month | Your time |
| **Flexibility** | Say what you want | Triggers/actions only | Unlimited but complex |
| **Maintenance** | Zero | Update broken zaps | Fix API changes |
| **Open source** | Yes (MIT) | No | Depends |
| **Tools available** | 550 | Varies | Whatever you build |

---

## The .0n Standard

0nMCP implements the **[.0n Standard](https://github.com/0nork/0n-spec)** — a universal configuration format for AI orchestration.

```
~/.0n/
├── config.json               # Global settings
├── connections/              # Service credentials as .0n files
│   ├── stripe.0n
│   ├── slack.0n
│   └── sendgrid.0n
├── workflows/                # Saved automation definitions
│   └── invoice-notify.0n
├── snapshots/                # System state captures
│   └── crm-setup.0n
├── history/                  # Execution logs (JSONL by date)
│   └── 2026-02-06.jsonl
└── cache/
```

Every connection is stored as a `.0n` file with a standard header:

```json
{
  "$0n": {
    "type": "connection",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "name": "Production Stripe"
  },
  "service": "stripe",
  "auth": {
    "type": "api_key",
    "credentials": { "api_key": "sk_live_..." }
  }
}
```

Every task execution is logged to `~/.0n/history/` as JSONL — full audit trail of what ran, when, and how.

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Service Catalog** | Defines all 26 services — their base URLs, endpoints, auth patterns, and capabilities |
| **Connection Manager** | Stores credentials as `.0n` files in `~/.0n/connections/` per the .0n standard |
| **Orchestrator** | The brain — parses natural language, plans multi-step execution, calls APIs, chains data |
| **CRM Modules** | 245 tools across 12 modules — data-driven, every tool is config not code |
| **Rate Limiter** | Per-service rate limits with automatic retry and backoff |
| **Webhook Handler** | Receive and process external events from connected services |
| **Execution History** | Logs every task to `~/.0n/history/` as JSONL — full audit trail |
| **TypeScript Defs** | Full type coverage for all exports, connections, workflows, and tools |

---

## Security

- **Local execution** — MCP server runs on your machine, not in the cloud
- **Direct API calls** — Requests go straight to each service, not through a proxy
- **Your credentials** — Stored locally in `~/.0n/connections/` as `.0n` files, never sent anywhere
- **Anthropic key** — Only used for task planning (never passed to external services)
- **Rate limiting** — Built-in per-service rate limits prevent accidental API abuse
- **Execution history** — Full audit trail in `~/.0n/history/`
- **Open source** — Audit every line yourself

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for our security policy and how to report vulnerabilities.

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | No | Enables AI-powered multi-step planning. Keyword matching without it. |

### Credential Storage

Connections stored as `.0n` files in `~/.0n/connections/`. For production:
- Use a secrets manager
- Enable encryption via `~/.0n/config.json`
- Use environment variables: `"api_key": "{{env.STRIPE_KEY}}"`

---

## For Developers

### Adding a New Service

Drop a definition into `catalog.js`:

```javascript
your_service: {
  name: "Your Service",
  type: "category",
  description: "What it does",
  baseUrl: "https://api.yourservice.com",
  authType: "api_key",
  credentialKeys: ["apiKey"],
  capabilities: [
    { name: "do_thing", actions: ["create", "list"], description: "Does the thing" },
  ],
  endpoints: {
    do_thing:    { method: "POST", path: "/things", body: { name: "" } },
    list_things: { method: "GET",  path: "/things" },
  },
  authHeader: (creds) => ({
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${creds.apiKey}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  }),
},
```

### Adding CRM Endpoints

Even easier — just add a config object to the relevant module:

```javascript
{
  name: "crm_do_thing",
  description: "Does the thing in the CRM",
  method: "POST",
  path: "/things/:thingId",
  params: {
    thingId: { type: "string", description: "Thing ID", required: true, in: "path" },
    name:    { type: "string", description: "Thing name", required: true, in: "body" },
  },
  body: ["name"],
}
```

The tool factory handles registration, validation, API calls, error handling — everything. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide.
